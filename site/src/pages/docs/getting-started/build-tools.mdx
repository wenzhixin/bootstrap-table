## Tooling setup

Bootstrap Table uses [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for its build system. Our [package.json]([[config:repo]]/blob/[[config:currentVersion]]/package.json) includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including linting code, compiling code, and more.

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Bootstrap Table's source files and Node. Follow these steps, and you should be ready to rock:

1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Navigate to the root `/bootstrap-table` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in [package.json]([[config:repo]]/blob/[[config:currentVersion]]/package.json).
3. **(Documentation site only)** If you want to set up the documentation site, navigate to the `/site` directory and run `npm install` to install Astro and other dependencies for the documentation site.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.


## Using NPM scripts

Our [package.json]([[config:repo]]/blob/[[config:currentVersion]]/package.json) includes the following commands and tasks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | `npm run build` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files. |
| `npm run lint` | Lints CSS and JavaScript for `/src` directory. |
| `npm run test` | Runs the project's test suite. |

Run `npm run` to see all the npm scripts.

## Local documentation

Running our documentation locally requires the use of Astro, a modern static site generator that provides us: component-based architecture, Markdown-based files, templates, and more. Here's how to get it started:

1. Run through the [tooling setup](#tooling-setup) above to install Astro and other dependencies.
2. Navigate to the `/site` directory and run `npm run dev` in the command line.
3. Open `http://localhost:4321` in your browser to view the local documentation site.

Learn more about using Astro by reading its [documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter installing dependencies, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.
