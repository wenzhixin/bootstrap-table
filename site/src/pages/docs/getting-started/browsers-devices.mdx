## Supported browsers

Bootstrap Table supports the **latest, stable releases** of all major browsers and platforms. We focus on modern browsers with good performance and security features.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap Table should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers. More specific support information is provided below.

You can find our supported range of browsers and their versions [in our `.browserslistrc file`]([[config:repo]]/blob/[[config:currentVersion]]/.browserslistrc):

```plaintext
# https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#readme

>= 0.5%
last 2 versions
not dead
Chrome >= 90
Firefox >= 88
Edge >= 90
Safari >= 14
iOS >= 14
Android >= 6
```

Because Bootstrap Table is designed for Bootstrap, we will try to be consistent with Bootstrap in browsers and devices compatibility. You can check out the [browsers and devices support of Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/browsers-devices/) for more detail.
