## Usage

```html
<script src="extensions/defer-url/bootstrap-table-defer-url.js"></script>
```

## Example

[Defer URL](https://examples.bootstrap-table.com/#extensions/defer-url.html)

## Options

### deferUrl

- **Attribute:** `data-defer-url`

- **type:** `String`

- **Detail:**

  When using server-side processing, the default mode of operation for bootstrap-table is to simply throw away any data that currently exists in the table and make a request to the server to get the first page of data to display. This is fine for an empty table, but if you already have the first page of data displayed in plain HTML, it is a waste of resources. As such, you can use `deferUrl` instead of `url` to allow you to instruct bootstrap-table to not make that initial request, rather it will use the data already on the page.

- **Default:** `null`
